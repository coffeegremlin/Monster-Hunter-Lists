#  Welcome Hunters 
Have you ever been three quests deep grinding for materials to upgrade your weapon only to realize halfway through the first quest, you forgot everything you were trying to gather? Did you have to visit the smith after every quest just to double check on what it was you needed? No longer will this be a probelem!

## The App
This app allows you to search through the Monster Hunter World API using a case sensitive search of a weapon's name. Then you can save that weapon to your own to-do list. From there you can add in What specific Items you have, and the individual quanities of each item in your inventory.
